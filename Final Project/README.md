This project is the beginning of bringing the world some of the most highly collectible air guitars that are still around today. My extensive collection of vintage air guitars has exceddingly grown throughout the years and now I have run out of room to display all of them. I decided to try and document as well sell some of the rarest and most sought after air guitars pelple have seen. I will continue to add to this site as I get better with my coding, but right now this is just the frame and walls for this home. Feel free to play around with the site and bask in the glory of instruments you only dreamed of.

This project is the culmination of that not so great progress. Hopefully my attempt at using Flexbox, along with my Media Queries and then using Javascript for my Validations and Showing and hiding my content, shows the progress I have made.

I"ve enjoyed this class, and hope to continue forward.

First off my name is Matt Leezer, currently a graphic designer for a local printing trying to expand my tools from the vector world to the world of syntax. This has been one of my favorite challenges so far, coming from a visual world where wyswyg, to learning a new language and retraining your brain to visualize what that language will do. It is slowly coming along, although maybe not great but still progressing none the less.

This project is the culmination of that not so great progress. Hopefully my attempt at using Flexbox, along with my Media Queries and then using Javascript for my Validations and Showing and hiding my content, shows the progress I have made.

I"ve enjoyed this class, and hope to continue forward.
